# WoodworkBerserk
Currently works entirely on localhost
Start server first (https://github.com/petertbdtu/WoodworkBerserkServer ) before starting client, on same machine.
Client should initially show 1x1 grass tile surrounded by blackness, with a figure in the top-left corner.
After connecting it will show 3x3 grass tiles and blackness, with 2 trees immediately below and to the right of the grass tiles.
Press arrow keys to send messages to server. Escape to send disconnect (not fully implemented serverside)
Server will additionally print output to console.
